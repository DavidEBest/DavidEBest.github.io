Time to hit the big reset button on [CandiedBrain][cbcom].

My name is Dave Best. I'm a thirty something software engineer from Dayton, Ohio. Like most people, I've got a wide range of interests. A few things I'm doing at the moment:

- Raising a family.
- Working at [LinQuest][linquest].
- Organizing [Startup Weekend Dayton][swdayton].
- Co-organizing [Code For Dayton][cfd]
- Blogging here (in theory).

I've delved into a few other niches - I've brewed some (decent) beer, written some (terrible) tabletop roleplaying games, and run a music podcast (also terrible). All of these things were discussed on the previous iteration of this blog and may be resurrected in this (or a future) iteration.

For the moment, most of my thoughts have been toward community organizing. I've finally hooked into the Dayton community in a real way and I want to be a productive force for change. I've never been a real 'live in public' kind of guy, but I am trying to do a better job of it. If you are interested in getting in touch with me, check out [davidebest.co][debco], which contains links to all the social network profiles I maintain.
